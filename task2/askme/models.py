    'text': 'Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows machines to learn and improve from '
    'experience, without being explicitly programmed. It involves using algorithms and statistical models to '
    'analyze and draw insights from data, and is used in a variety of applications such as image recognition, '
    'natural language processing, and predictive analytics.',

    'started: 1) Write clear, concise, and well-documented code, 2) Use descriptive variable and function '
    'using loops and functions, and 5) Use libraries and modules to simplify your code and make it more '
    'efficient. Some helpful resources for learning more about Python best practices include PEP 8, the '
    'official style guide for Python code, and the book "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin.',

    'text': 'Optimizing SQL queries can be a complex task, but here are a few tips to get started: 1) Use indexes '
    'to speed up queries on large tables, 2) Avoid using subqueries or joins where possible, as these '
    'can slow down performance, 3) Use the EXPLAIN statement to analyze query performance and identify '
    'bottlenecks, 4) Limit the number of rows returned by your queries, and 5) Use stored procedures '
    'to improve performance and reduce network traffic. For more detailed information on SQL optimization, '
    'you may want to consult a book or online resource specifically dedicated to the topic.',
